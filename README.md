# (Bayesian) Applied Modelling in Drug Development (BAMDD)

Flexible Bayesian regression modelling in Stan via `brms`

## About

This website contains materials that were developed to accompany a series of 
workshops held in the Analytics department at Novartis over 2022-2024,
illustrating the utility of the R package `brms` for solving drug-
development problems. In order to highlight the versatility of that package,
we have developed a collection of case studies covering a diverse set of 
clinical and statistical questions that were addressed via Bayesian modelling 
with the `brms` package. 

## Requirements

- quarto 
- cmdstanr and cmdstan (`cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`)
