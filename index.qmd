# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website contains materials that were developed to accompany a series of 
workshops held in the Analytics department at Novartis over 2022-2024,
illustrating the utility of the R package `brms` for solving drug-
development problems. In order to highlight the versatility of that package,
we have developed a collection of case studies covering a diverse set of 
clinical questions that were addressed via Bayesian modelling with the `brms` package. 

## Navigating the site

The material is organized as follows:

- @sec-introduction introduces `brms` and the objectives of these vignettes
- @sec-basic-workflow highlights the basic workflow (analysis steps and 
syntax) for carrying out an analysis with `brms`
- The next series of sections contain the case
studies. You can find a [listing with descriptions on this page](src/02_case_studies.qmd).
- Sections @sec-stan-code and @sec-parallel cover more technical topics, such
as exposing and injecting custom stan code to `brms` models,
and efficient parallel computation to support sampling in `brms`.
