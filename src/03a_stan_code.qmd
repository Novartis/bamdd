# Exposing stan code {#sec-stan-code}

In some situations it can be useful to make use of the Stan functions
`brms` uses inside the Stan programs it creates. This is for example
the case when creating a custom family as described in the [vignette
on custom response
distributions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_customfamilies.html). Whenever
defining a custom family, one does provide Stan code snippets to
`brms` which are used to setup the respective Stan model. Since the
same functions are then useful for post-proccessing of the model
posterior, the created functions can be used in R as well using the
`expose_functions` from `brms`. Please refer to the vignette on custom
families and the help on the expose function utility function
`?expose_functions`.
