These methods, however, often manifest a key conceptual tension in prior modeling: a model encoding true prior information should be chosen without reference to the model of the measurement process, but almost all common prior modeling techniques are implicitly motivated by a reference likelihood. In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation.},

   abstract = {In Bayesian random‐effects meta‐analysis, the use of weakly informative prior distributions is of particular benefit in cases where only a few studies are included, a situation often encountered in health technology assessment (HTA). Suggestions for empirical prior distributions are available in the literature but it is unknown whether these are adequate in the context of HTA. Therefore, a database of all relevant meta‐analyses conducted by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG, Germany) was constructed to derive empirical prior distributions for the heterogeneity parameter suitable for HTA. Previously, an extension to the normal‐normal hierarchical model had been suggested for this purpose. For different effect measures, this extended model was applied on the database to conservatively derive a prior distribution for the heterogeneity parameter. Comparison of a Bayesian approach using the derived priors with IQWiG's current standard approach for evidence synthesis shows favorable properties. Therefore, these prior distributions are recommended for future meta‐analyses in HTA settings and could be embedded into the IQWiG evidence synthesis approach in the case of very few studies.},

A Bayesian approach to estimation allows external evidence on the expected magnitude of heterogeneity to be incorporated. The aim of this paper is to provide tools that improve the accessibility of Bayesian meta-analysis. We present two methods for implementing Bayesian meta-analysis, using numerical integration and importance sampling techniques. Based on 14,886 binary outcome meta-analyses in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, we derive a novel set of predictive distributions for the degree of heterogeneity expected in 80 settings depending on the outcomes assessed and comparisons made. These can be used as prior distributions for heterogeneity in future meta-analyses. The two methods are implemented in R, for which code is provided. Both methods produce equivalent results to standard but more complex Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches. The priors are derived as log-normal distributions for the between-study variance, applicable to meta-analyses of binary outcomes on the log odds-ratio scale. The methods are applied to two example meta-analyses, incorporating the relevant predictive distributions as prior distributions for between-study heterogeneity. We have provided resources to facilitate Bayesian meta-analysis, in a form accessible to applied researchers, which allow relevant prior information on the degree of heterogeneity to be incorporated.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new concept for constructing prior distributions. We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

  abstract  = {Prior distributions for high-dimensional linear regression require specifying a joint distribution for the unobserved regression coefficients, which is inherently difficult. We instead propose a new class of shrinkage priors for linear regression via specifying a prior first on the model fit, in particular, the coefficient of determination, and then distributing through to the coefficients in a novel way. The proposed method compares favorably to previous approaches in terms of both concentration around the origin and tail behavior, which leads to improved performance both in posterior contraction and in empirical performance. The limiting behavior of the proposed prior is (Formula presented.), both around the origin and in the tails. This behavior is optimal in the sense that it simultaneously lies on the boundary of being an improper prior both in the tails and around the origin. None of the existing shrinkage priors obtain this behavior in both regions simultaneously. We also demonstrate that our proposed prior leads to the same near-minimax posterior contraction rate as the spike-and-slab prior. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

While noninformative priors are commonly used for the overall mean effect, the use of weakly informative priors has been suggested for the heterogeneity parameter, in particular in the setting of (very) few studies.

                  use in a given context. The choice of method can

                  shown to increase efficiency and power over the
                  unadjusted method in estimating the marginal effect
                  of treatment. However, for binary outcomes,
                  investigators generally rely on the unadjusted
                  estimate as the literature indicates that
                  covariate-adjusted estimates based on the logistic
                  regression models are less efficient. The crucial
                  step that has been missing when adjusting for
                  covariates is that one must integrate/average the
                  adjusted estimate over those covariates in order to
                  obtain the marginal effect. We apply the method of
                  targeted maximum likelihood estimation (tMLE) to
                  obtain estimators for the marginal effect using
                  covariate adjustment for binary outcomes. We show
                  that the covariate adjustment in randomized trials
                  using the logistic regression models can be mapped,
                  by averaging over the covariate(s), to obtain a
                  fully robust and efficient estimator of the marginal
                  effect, which equals a targeted maximum likelihood
                  estimator. This tMLE is obtained by simply adding a
                  clever covariate to a fixed initial regression. We
                  present simulation studies that demonstrate that
                  this tMLE increases efficiency and power over the
                  unadjusted method, particularly for smaller sample
                  sizes, even when the regression model is

                  used for estimating proportions or rates. However,
                  it is not well known that the conventional
                  noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the
                  posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward
                  the middle of the parameter space, making them thus
                  appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is
                  always largest when the number of observed events is
                  small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes
                  and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore
                  most conspicuous and potentially controversial when
                  analyzing rare events. As alternative default
                  conjugate priors, I introduce Beta(1/3, 1/3) and
                  Gamma(1/3, 0), which I call ‘neutral’ priors because
                  they lead to posterior distributions with
                  approximately 50 per cent probability that the true
                  value is either smaller or larger than the maximum
                  likelihood estimate. This holds for all sample sizes

                  discuss the construction of informative prior
                  distributions. Under the suggested formulation, the
                  posterior median coincides approximately with the
                  weighted average of the prior median and the sample
                  mean, yielding priors that perform more intuitively
                  than those obtained by matching moments and
                  quantiles.},

   abstract = {Use of historical data in clinical trial design and analysis has shown various advantages such as reduction of number of subjects and increase of study power. The metaanalytic-predictive (MAP) approach accounts with a hierarchical model for between-trial heterogeneity in order to derive an informative prior from historical data. In this paper, we introduce the package RBesT (R Bayesian evidence synthesis tools) which implements the MAP approach with normal (known sampling standard deviation), binomial and Poisson endpoints. The hierarchical MAP model is evaluated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The MCMC samples representing the MAP prior are approximated with parametric mixture densities which are obtained with the expectation maximization algorithm. The parametric mixture density representation facilitates easy communication of the MAP prior and enables fast and accurate analytical procedures to evaluate properties of trial designs with informative MAP priors. The paper first introduces the framework of robust Bayesian evidence synthesis in this setting and then explains how RBesT facilitates the derivation and evaluation of an informative MAP prior from historical control data. In addition we describe how the meta-analytic framework relates to further applications including probability of success calculations.},

@article{Neuenschwander2010,
   abstract = {BACKGROUND Historical information is always relevant when designing clinical trials, but it might also be incorporated in the analysis. It seems appropriate to exploit past information on comparable control groups. PURPOSE Phase IV and proof-of-concept trials are used to discuss aspects of summarizing historical control data as prior information in a new trial. The importance of a fair assessment of the similarity of control parameters is emphasized. METHODS The methodology is meta-analytic-predictive. Heterogeneity of control parameters is expressed via the between-trial variation, which is the key parameter determining the prior effective sample size and its upper bound (prior maximum sample size). RESULTS For a Phase IV trial (930 control patients in 11 historical trials) between-trial heterogeneity was fairly small, resulting in a prior effective sample size of approximately 90 patients. For a proof-of-concept trial (363 patients in four historical trials) heterogeneity was moderate to substantial, resulting in a prior effective sample size of approximately 20. For another proof-of-concept trial (14 patients in one historical trial), assuming substantial heterogeneity implied a prior effective sample size of 7. The prior effective sample size can only be large if the amount of historical data is large and between-trial heterogeneity is small. The prior effective sample size is bounded by the prior maximum sample size (ratio of within- to between-trial variance), irrespective of the amount of historical data. LIMITATIONS The meta-analytic-predictive approach assumes exchangeability of control parameters across trials. Due to the difficulty to quantify between-trial variability, sensitivity of conclusions regarding assumptions and type of inference should be assessed. CONCLUSIONS The use of historical control information is a valuable option and may lead to more efficient clinical trials. The proposed approach is attractive for nonconfirmatory trials, but under certain circumstances extensions to the confirmatory setting could be envisaged as well.},
